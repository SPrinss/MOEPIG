Good comprehensive book on learning itself [here](http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/LearningBiology/readings/How-people-learn.pdf).
Also check the recent book [Make it stick](http://www.bol.com/nl/p/make-it-stick/9200000021705848/), it's well written (and Alexander's personal favorite on effective learning)
