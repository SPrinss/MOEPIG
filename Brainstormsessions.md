# Brainstorm session #2

**Collaborative content creation**. Viewing new content costs points. **Points** are earned by contributing to the website (e.g. creating new items, answering questions, posing questions) or by paying money. The contributions will lead to a wide diversity in items, **giving you always something that fits for you at that moment**: 
- the medium
- depth of the knowledge
- information density (e.g. use of jargon) 
- interface
- device used
- formal vs informal language
- background of the creator

The learner can move **sliders** to indicate the type of items he/she would like to see at that moment for that learning goal. There are no courses but journey with certain slider settings from a point to another point (Context specific learning path). Items can be improved by learners for other learners with that background and those slider settings. The optimal answer is personal.
 
By **A-B testing** we can investigate whether the item is suitable for somebody with knowledge background x and slider settings y. A possible measurement would be drop-off rate, how often somebody pauzes/stops learning at that item. Subjective grading might be difficult (and unnecessary?) because it will likely automatically create filter bubbles where people are reaffirmed in their (wrong) beliefs.
Small teams could work together to tackle a certain problem. *However, for creating content you need to be at a certain knowledge level to explain something in an effective way (?)*. Eventually experts in a field might work together with user experience designers to create top items. These groups might be (monetarily) compensated if their content is very often used.
 
## Starting product

**Statistics course** with 10x10 items. The items differ in specific learning processes (e.g.depth of the information, the medium). Might want to work together with other parties for the content (jasp_stats.org, statistiekfabriek, online websites). Goal is to create a working product, design the platform, test A-B testing and create momentum.
