_This is the ReadMe file, it's purpose is to clarify how this GutHub Repository is used and how we work together._

# MOEPIG

Here we want to create an internal repository of knowledge and what we know for sure.

# Using this GitHub Repository

To work together to make what is in this _GitHub Repository_ something we can share and stand behind the idea is that we change things in our own branches and subsequently merge them using _Pull Requests_. This way we can all be up to date with what is changing and what is being added. As a rule, if you change a file do not merge that file yourself.

There are some great tutorials and explanations on how to use GitHub on [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/).

## How do I change something

1. Create a new branch with a short name that describes your changes.
2. Edit or create the files you think need to be changed, per change commit your changes with a short descriptive explanation of your change.
3. When content with what you have changed, [create a new _Pull Request_](https://github.com/NewAtoms/MOEPIG/compare) give it a descriptive title.
4. Ask people to review your _Pull Request_ by `@` mentioning them in the description of that _Pull Request_. If you mention the _Issue_ number that it resolves, use `fixes #15` (or whatever number your _Issue_ has) and it will automatically close the _Issue_ when the _Pull Request_ is closed.
5. If everyone is happy, have someone else merge your _Pull Request_ and delete it's branch.

# Using Issues

We use [_GitHub Issues_](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track everything we want to do in the future and everything we want to do now. If there is something we need to do:

1. [add an _Issue_](https://github.com/NewAtoms/MOEPIG/issues/new).
2. make it's title either a _User Story_ or a _Problem Statement_.
3. Explain yourself if you feel that it is necessary in the description field, and `@` mention those who you think need to know about this issue.

Try to be as precise as possible. This will allow us to be on the same page and forces you to really think about what the actual issue is. Issues can be on a big picture- and on a small, very temporary, scale.

If you doing something, assign yourself. Do not assign others to tasks, as it is useful to be able what someone is actually doing at that moment. Try not to assign things to yourself you are not yet going to do as others might be able to do it before you.

Please add labels and add to milestones where necessary.

### Issue titles

As a general rule of thumb, an issue title never states how something should be solved, this is always up to the implementer.

### User story

Try to be as precise as possible. This will allow us to be on the same page and forces you to really think about what the actual issue is. 

Issues can be on a big picture- and on a small, very temporary, scale.A [_User Story_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) describes the situation **after** it has been resolved and always has the following form:

> To _[**benefit**]_ as a _[**user**]_ I can _[**goal**]_

### Problem statement

This is a more loose approach that allows you to define a problem that needs to be resolved.
