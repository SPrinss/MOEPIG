## Brainstorm #3

# Vision
We want everybody to learn what matters most to them in a joyful, meaningful and effective way.

# Projects
The Grid - Path recommendation engine
           subproject - [LTI link](http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm). module for other content generators (Coursera etc)

The Grid - Collaborative content creation framework 


## The Grid big picture
Ways of learning are: Dimension (video, text, animation ..), type of language ((in)formal, jargon use ..), 
depth of the information / previous knowledge (real world examples vs abstract requiring prequisite knowledge), instruction vs questions & hints.

User generated content that creates items for all types of learning. 

Analytics will guide learning so it's in the most joyful and effective way (A-B testing, AI, etc.). Need multiple timepoints per user.

Identifying the gap in the knowledge (missing nodes) and via hints guide you through the nodes.

## The Grid experiment
X by X Grid: X different content types and X different ways of learning.

Pick one beginner statistic topic.

Search for content online, copy it to markdown files.

Create a website that shows random Markdown files.

Use Google analytics for tracking user behaviour.
