# Two products:
- The Grid
- Ques (new avenue, see below)
- (Porn – Personalized online recommendation network ;)

Experiment with both products. Everybody will spend time on the project what motivates them most at that moment. 

Two types of learning: Drifty user or circling user (around nodes)
- Want to your question answered at that time / learning by associations
- Want to learn a specific topic in depth

Ques might be better for the first style while the Grid might might suit the second type better (?)

# Next steps:
For the Grid: find out how to teach statistics (copy from books). Search for statistics content online (small issue), put in MD files. 
Create script that generates websites -> Google analytics

Ques: Interface for inputting questions and a graph database to store the questions.
Think of an interface that is intuitive. (that allows for asking questions that will result in a certain learning context (e.g. visual))
Create User stories for this product


# Ques

Ques: Chains of questions. Associations are mapped. Users can continuously ask follow up questions or hop to already asked questions.

Everything can be learned in multiple ways.
Optimal learning will be different for persons.
Is there a chain of dependencies in learning? Is it a web? It's a network, not a pyramid. Relationships, not dependencies. 

Meaningful learning:
1 Make sense of the learning content itself
2 Make sense of  the learning situation.
3. Those two need to be related to yourself as a person
Mismatch between the content, learning situation and yourself in that situation (for example a neuroscience class for Timo). 

Zooming out, big picture. It helps relate the details and increases motivation for learning the details if you see how they fit in the big picture (web of knowledge?).
But don’t force people to make a conscious decision about what they want to learn next, won’t work.
Realization: If you experience joy in learning then you don’t ask yourself why you are learning something.
If learning is fun (some) people  don’t describe it as learning.

Use tags to solve multidimensional?
Content has a tag, but also: medium, formal/informal etc.  Ask user: select what you want to learn.
Tags might force generalized learning instead of a personal journey. Might be difficult to hop around in a natural way.
How many tags are needed to describe the relationships in a sufficient way?
Also: Tags might lead to other problems (didn't go into it, Wouter had some ideas)
Taxonomy (categorizing) is not sufficient. All hops are relevant. 

Exercise: What is this? (white piece of paper)
10 steps from that node. 
Result: People's associations float in different directions; some overlap. Very many ways to learn what paper is!
If enough people ask the same question than that questions should be answered (by users). 
(really rewarding to answer a question if you know that 1000+ people would like to know the answer)
Can choose to answer their own question or leave it and ask the next question.
Possible: You ask a question and someone says “Hey you should be asking this question” .
Maybe you can post your own thought process when posting the link? This will motivate someone to answer the question if the original explanation is incorrect.

Interesting to see how people hop -> commercial product?
A way to find out what kind of learner someone is by looking at the questions that person asked. 
Question graph. Mapping people’s questions. Every question is a product 

Feedback system which tells you that you hopped too far? (depends on your use of the site)
Can track people who try to tackle a certain topic and see how long it takes them.
You explore other peoples associations.
Inspired by the system.
High from sharing information / solving someone’s problem.

# Ques interface problems
Abundance of questions? How to rank them? How to couple similar questions but written slightly different? (look at Yahoo answers? Merged by users?)
Rank questions to how many time it is asked / how good the answer is / how people rank the question?
Rewrite other user's questions? 

How can someone ask a question that results in a learning context that suits his/her needs.
Would a visual learner ask that question? Art of asking questions. But how do you motivate users to propose the questions in a useful way?
Possible: Select a few learning context factors and you will only see answers that are answered in that context.
