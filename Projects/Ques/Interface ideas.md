## Word pool
Most questions start with a word from a small wordpool:
- what
- how 
- who
- when
- why
- to do (does playing computer games make you more agressive)
- to be (is 1+1=2?)
- to have (has there ever been anyone more charming than Putin?)

## Question phrasing
To get the answer you are looking for you have to incorporate a lot of information into a question.
For example:
I want to know what type of question will result in an answer given in a certain learning context (e.g. visual).

I can ask:
What is a good way to ask questions? 
However the answers to this question will be very broad, from job interview styles to question types.

So you have to incorporate what you'd like the answer to look like. 

How can I phrase my question about probability in such a way that the answer will explain probability in a visual and non-jargon way?

Users of the site perhaps won't automatically do this, and perhaps it will even hamper the flow of learning. However, it might be crucial for the site since otherwise the questions will not be answered by relevant answers.

**So: Is there a way that we can incorporate a user story type of questioning that will not hamper flow?**

## Answers
How much more effort will it take to be able to incorporate answering the questions into the framework/interface?
